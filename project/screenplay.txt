Narrator: 
This is raw video.  As near as I can tell, it  was shot in Klamath Falls, Oregon sometime in August 2012.  What you will see are two kids who decided to brandish their right to openly carry their assault-rifle-looking firearms through town.  The obviously were expecting some kind of confrontation.  Watch how the arriving officer handles it.
